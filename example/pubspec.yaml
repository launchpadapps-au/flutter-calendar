# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
#
# This version is used _only_ for the Runner app, which is used if you just do
# a `flutter run` or a `flutter make-host-app-editable`. It has no impact
# on any other native host app that you embed your Flutter project into.

  # To add Flutter specific assets to your application, add an assets section,
  # like this:
  assets:
    - assets/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add Flutter specific custom fonts to your application, add a fonts
  # section here, in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should
  # have a "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Sofia Pro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/sofiapro-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/sofiapro-bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        # - asset: fonts/sofiapro-light.ttf
        #   style: light
        # - asset: fonts/sofiapro-medium.ttf
        #   style: medium
        # - asset: fonts/sofiapro-semibold.ttf
        #   style: semibold
    - family: NotoSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSans-Italic.ttf
          style: italic

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
  # This section identifies your Flutter project as a module meant for
  # embedding in a native host app.  These identifiers should _not_ ordinarily
  # be changed after generation - they are used to ensure that the tooling can
  # maintain consistency when adding or modifying assets and plugins.
  # They also do not have any bearing on your native host application's
  # identifiers, which may be completely independent or the same as these.
